## The Big Issues of Data Storage
In Vaultastic's article, [Twelve most prominent challenges of Data Storage and Data Management](https://vaultastic.mithi.com/blogs/12-biggest-challenges-data-storage-data-management/), they go into the multiple issues that companies are struggling with when it comes to data storage. While there are some solutions for these isses, it feels like there is an abundance of applications that are built to counteract these kinds of problems. However, the process of finding which application works best to solve a company's specific data storage and managment problem would be tedious to implement, especially if they are circling through multiple possible solutions. 

Before reading this article I actually didn't realize there were so many seperate issues under Data Storage as a subject. A lot of the issues covered show why the intersection of Database Design and Data Managment is so important. As without proper management, important data might be scattered across too many mediums, and also the company might not be able to have a proper glimpse into the future of their data predictability in how much extra space they might need for data storage in the future.

## Data Storage Methods that Might Benefit Storage Struggling Businesses
In Helixstorm's article, [What Data Storage Method is Best for your Business?](https://www.helixstorm.com/blog/the-best-data-storage-method-for-your-business/#:~:text=Colocation%20Services&text=One%20of%20the%20main%20benefits,to%20manage%20their%20data%20storage.), they explore possible data storage options and methods that might help businesses store their data in the specific way they desire. They speak on certain applications that can help store large data either privately, publically, or a hybrid of both accessabilties. The necessary difference in using different accessability on storage is important so the right people can have access to the right information. 

So private data is mainly for storing more "behind the scenes" things from the company, like their infrastrucure, security, or maintenance controls. This would either be a form of hardware to hold the data or a network system accessible to a certain area and their drives. Public data storage is more for the convience. Just how most cloud based systems work, this system allows users to access their data anywhere with internet. However, as most data does they can get corrupted or lost, especially when its remotely saved on the cloud, it would be best to keep a hard copy backup.
